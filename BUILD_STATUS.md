# Windows Build Progress

## Current Status
üîÑ Installing Wine 32-bit support (required for Windows builds on Linux)

This installation will take approximately 5-10 minutes depending on your internet speed.

---

## What's Happening:

1. ‚úÖ **Wine 64-bit** - Installed
2. üîÑ **Wine 32-bit** - Installing (246 MB, ~1.1 GB installed)
3. ‚è≥ **Windows Build** - Pending (will start after Wine32 completes)

---

## After Installation Completes:

The build process will automatically:
1. Package your Electron app for Windows
2. Bundle all dependencies (node_modules, renderer files, database files)
3. Create two types of executables:
   - **NSIS Installer** (`AIBrowseX Setup 1.0.0.exe`) - ~200-300 MB
   - **Portable Version** (`AIBrowseX 1.0.0.exe`) - ~200-300 MB

---

## Expected Build Time:
- Wine32 installation: **5-10 minutes** ‚è±Ô∏è
- Windows packaging: **3-5 minutes** üì¶
- **Total: 8-15 minutes**

---

## Alternative: Build on Windows PC (Faster & Simpler)

If you have access to a Windows computer:

```bash
# On Windows CMD or PowerShell:
git clone https://github.com/vishalharkal15/AIBrowseX-.git
cd AIBrowseX-
npm install
npm run build:win
```

This will be much faster as it doesn't require Wine.

---

## What You'll Get:

### `dist/AIBrowseX Setup 1.0.0.exe` (Installer)
- Creates Start Menu entry
- Desktop shortcut
- Auto-update capability
- Professional installation experience
- **Recommended for distribution to end users**

### `dist/AIBrowseX 1.0.0.exe` (Portable)
- No installation needed
- Run from anywhere (USB drive, Downloads folder, etc.)
- No admin rights required
- **Great for testing or portable use**

---

## Important Notes:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Python Backend**: The Python backend files are included, but users need Python installed separately, OR you can bundle Python as an executable using PyInstaller:

```bash
cd backend
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --hidden-import anthropic main.py
```

This creates `backend/dist/main.exe` which can be bundled with your app.

---

## Distribution Checklist:

Before sharing your .exe with others:

- [ ] Test on a clean Windows machine (without Python/Node.js)
- [ ] Verify all UI features work
- [ ] Test AI features with API key
- [ ] Check database creation works
- [ ] Include `README.md` with setup instructions
- [ ] Document system requirements
- [ ] Create user guide with screenshots

---

## System Requirements (for end users):

**Minimum:**
- Windows 10 64-bit or Windows 11
- 4 GB RAM
- 500 MB free disk space
- Internet connection (for AI features)

**Recommended:**
- Windows 11
- 8 GB RAM
- 1 GB free disk space
- Broadband internet

---

## Next Steps:

1. ‚è≥ Wait for Wine32 installation to complete
2. üî® Build process will start automatically
3. ‚úÖ Test the `.exe` file in the `dist/` folder
4. üì§ Upload to GitHub Releases or distribute
